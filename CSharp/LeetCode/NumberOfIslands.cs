    /**
     * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. 
     * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
     * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

        Example 1:

        11110
        11010
        11000
        00000

        Answer: 1

        Example 2:

        11000
        11000
        00100
