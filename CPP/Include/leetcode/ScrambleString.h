// Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree 
// by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.
//
// To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.
// Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.
