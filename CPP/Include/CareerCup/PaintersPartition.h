//You have to paint N boards of length{ A0, A1, A2 … AN - 1 }.
//There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board.
//
//You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints 
//that any painter will only paint continuous sections of board, 
//say board{ 2, 3, 4 } or only board{ 1 } or nothing but not board{ 2, 4, 5 }.

// Given an array of non-negative integers A and a positive integer k, we want to:
// Divide A into k or fewer partitions, such that the maximum sum over all the partitions is minimized.
